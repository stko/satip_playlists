  <h1>The server works!</h1>
  <p>
    But here would be a nice place for an online playlist editor -
    so if somebody would like to, please feel free to go to the
    <a href="https://github.com/stko/simply_tv">Project Page</a>
    and create and add your editor
  </p>

  <p>Here you can also find two support pages
  <ul>
    <li><a href="./room/all">The unmodified m3u inputs</a></li>
    <li><a href="./room/stations">All station names as blueprint for your favorite config list</a></li>
  </ul>
